WrecksShop is a Discord-based bot for delivering items to players in-game. It is compatible with Tip4Serv donation shops, as well.

Description:
* Runs from a desktop GUI that will allow adding, removing & editing of shop items.
* GUI monitors both functional and error logs with optional saving to local files.
* Includes integration with SQL databases.
* Plug and play -- enter your information into the GUI (i.e., items to be sold, discord bot token, RCON credentials, discord channels/roles, etc.), and it will generate the appropriate files without you having to manually edit the code itself.
* Customizable -- set custom broadcast/in-game messages for shop functions, customize which logs to send where, etc.
* Skips the need for other tools -- no need to use companion plug-ins or bots! This tool is designed to be standalone to reduce the number of resources needed, but can still be integrated with certain plug-ins for Ark Ascended & Discord that allow seamless overall function.

Installing:
* Unzip the file into the location you'd like your bot files to go, then simply double-click on the .exe file to begin the configuration process. You'll be able to start & stop the bot from the GUI after your config is complete.

Help:
* This is very much still a work-in-progress that will be changing frequently. Any questions about the bot, GUI, or suggestions can be directed to my discord: https://discord.gg/smXr7pQ37V
